# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub Page. I am a Software Developer who likes to delve into all technologies and make fun things at home (which i dump onto here)!

## About Me

I’m an innovative and versatile developer with over 5 years of experience across the full stack — from frontend to backend, DevOps to UI/UX design — and now working in AI/ML model development. I graduated as Graduate Student of the Year from Lamar University with a Master’s in Computer Science, a 4.00 GPA, and a published thesis in 2022. I recently completed a Postgraduate Program in AI & Machine Learning at the University of Texas at Austin in 2025.

Currently, I work at an AI/ML startup where I:

  - Train and optimize machine learning models

  - Lead a team of data labelers

  - Built core features from scratch such as camera detection/removal systems, sky masking and generation

  - Implement performance improvements and tackle tough bugs across the codebase

  - Contribute to both backend services and frontend applications

  - Wear all the hats (and sometimes invent new ones)
